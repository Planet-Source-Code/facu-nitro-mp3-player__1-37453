Nitro! Mp3 Player.

The littlest possible window, prepared to focus all your attention on the music

[IMPORTANT!]
You should compile it before running it. And after that, associate it, moving your mouse over the icon that apears on the systray and clicking on the app icon.
A window will open and you will find a button with "associate" as a caption.
To open an mp3, double click on the file after associating this program, or drag the mp3 into the compiled app.
The rest is very simple.

[Known Bugs]
The window goes up and down... I didn't know how to solve it

Have FUN!!!
